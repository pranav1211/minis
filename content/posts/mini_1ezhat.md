**What the hell indeed.**

I genuinely have no idea how February went by so fast. It feels like just a week ago I wrote my January review. But time doesn’t wait for anyone, so let’s get on with it.

I don’t remember much from the start of the month, but looking back at my notes, it’s all coming back.

I worked on some computer vision projects for work. I’ve learned a lot and it’s a really interesting field, and I can feel myself getting more comfortable with it. That part of the month felt productive and meaningful.

Blog-wise, I published only one piece which feels unfortunate because I had so much more planned. The one I did publish was my **[2025 F1 season review](https://medium.com/@beyondmebtw/the-2025-formula-1-season-review-00240674d77a)**. I started it in January, and it somehow took the entire month to finish. But honestly, it felt really nice writing it. I’m proud of it. I just didn’t get the chance to write the other pieces I had in mind like a guide to the new season and some movie and TV reviews.

It’s race week now, and that feeling of emptiness will disappear soon. F1 is something I genuinely enjoy. It gives me something to look forward to, something to analyze, something to feel. Maybe getting back into that rhythm will help me enjoy everything else more too.

This month I also started a **[dopamine detox](https://minis.beyondmebtw.com/post/mini_xx0ai0/)**. The first week was fine. The second week is still ongoing, so we’ll see how it turns out. It’s an experiment for now.

Apart from that, the month just flew by. I had an exam which went well. And slowly, it’s starting to sink in that college life is ending. I have no regrets about how I spent my time or who I spent it with. I did what I wanted to do. I learned a lot. I built things. But I’ll wait for it to actually end before I let myself get nostalgic.

I’ve also been feeling a bit sad because of everything going on in the world. I won’t go into detail as it’s just depressing. I try to stay off social media because of the detox and because of the constant noise, but whenever I do see the news, it sucks. The answer isn’t to avoid it completely because you can’t. It’s about finding a way through it. I know it’s privileged to even say that compared to what others are going through, but all I can really do is keep a positive attitude and focus on building what I can.

March should be a fun one. I’m getting back into the groove of writing and creating again. With F1 starting up, that momentum will probably only grow.

**Full speed ahead.**
