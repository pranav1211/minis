Welcome to a new series.  
This is a monthly review, sometimes short, sometimes long, always messy. The goal is simple: reflect on what was done and figure out what needs to be done next. No rules. Let’s get into it.

January flew by. It’s wild how so much happened, yet it still feels like the year started yesterday.

On the blog front, I only published two posts: my [2025 yearly recap](https://medium.com/@beyondmebtw/hello-2026-310901fa0fab) and [The *Running Man* movie review](https://medium.com/@beyondmebtw/the-running-man-movie-review-55bbc72897ab). I wanted to write more, but I’m still figuring out work–life balance. Working from home, shifting responsibilities, and changing workflows make it harder than expected. That said, my internship is genuinely rewarding I worked on two projects that made it to production. I learned a lot about production environments, backend APIs, databases, and UX. Even with some design background, it’s easy to get stuck thinking like just a developer. I’m learning to catch those mistakes early and move forward.

As a part of work, I’ve been deep in computer vision research especially with the depth camera I have. I’ve been exploring world models, robotics, 3D object modeling, point clouds, inference engines, and compression patterns. It’s niche, it’s complex, and it’s exactly what I want to be doing. There’s more to explore, and I’m not stopping.

Procrastination, though? Heavy.  
I’ve wanted to make changes across my platform, expand things, and push forward but inertia crept in. This is creative work, and sometimes even the things you love start to feel like chores. I don’t hate what I do, but that mental block exists. The way out has been routine, forcing structure where motivation dips. That’s partly why this monthly review exists. No more waiting. Let’s just get it done.

February is stacked.  
Backend and frontend revamps for the Minis platform. A content server overhaul. Simplifying my main site (uniform styling is already underway). Writing pending reviews— The 2025 F1 season, *Parasite*, *Now You See Me 3*. F1 Preseason testing is around the corner, *Drive to Survive* Season 8 is coming, and that’ll be very interesting.

To conclude,
Let’s get started, baby.
