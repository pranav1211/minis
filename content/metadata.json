Now my current version is basically just checking if the device is connected no OpenCV, nothing extra, just DepthAI.\n\nAfter some back and forth with settings (and still battling the AI feeding me old information), I managed to create an APK that actually compiled the DepthAI library and built successfully. The only issue is that it was built under the assumption that the PC, phone, and OAK were all connected together. The APK ended up being around 400 MB, which isn’t a big deal, but now the next step is to strip it down: build a minimal UI and get this raw functionality working.\n\nFor now, I’ve had to pause because of some external device issues, but I’ll get back to it soon. In the meantime, I want to focus, reflect, and most importantly get my latest F1 recap out.\n\nAnd that’s where my progress stands. If nothing else, I’ve already learned that frustration and failure are just part of the process. The important thing is that I’m still moving, even when it feels like I’m standing still."
