I’m finally back with a live blog, it’s been a while. I’ve still been writing: show reviews, bits about life, and recently, that whole journey with the DepthAI project. But this one hits differently. This one comes after getting hit with a brick. Not literally… though honestly, that might feel easier than what this past quarter has been.

When I look back at the last three months, I’ve been carrying the entire software world’s sins on my shoulders. If Android has an error, **I** feel broken. My dad told me straight: I need to stop taking every bug personally. And he’s right, I’ve tied every failure to who I am. It’s gotten bad enough that I don’t work because I fear either succeeding… or failing again.

What is worse? I chase errors now. Because if I find one, I get a free pass to delay everything till the next big disaster. And I’ve been doing exactly that.

I’m scared. **Really** scared. And it’s not like I’m behind, everything is up to date, files ready, environment set. One click to build and I still backed away.

If I keep running from problems like this, why am I even in software? This is a crisis of confidence, plain and simple, It's the worry that people will think less of me… or worse, that **I** will.

There will always be problems. That’s the job. But once you solve them, they’re gone. I don’t have to carry them forever.

So I’m leaving all that weight behind. Not looking back. Just driving forward — fast, focused, relentless until I get tired. And even when I do, I’ll rest without regret. As Elsa said "Let It Go!"

It’s a new month, the final stretch of the year. I’m not waiting for signs or motivation or fate to approve my progress. I’m done with that.

I’m capable. I’ve got this.

And yes — expect the DepthAI project to be up and running very soon.
