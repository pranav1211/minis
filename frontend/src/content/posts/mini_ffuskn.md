# The First of Many

---

The wait is finally over!  

After 2 weeks, and roughly 12 hours of development — it’s here. I present to you **Minis by *Beyond Me Btw* **.  

A live blogging platform where I can share quick updates and thoughts that don’t need a fully produced blog post. It could be a small discovery in tech, a movie review I didn’t enjoy, or just something I feel like talking about.  

With Minis, I can give live commentary on projects without waiting until the very end.  

And this is just the start. I’ve got more features planned, maybe even a Twitter bot for fun, and plenty more to come.  

**Stay Tuned, The best is yet to come!**
