<p><strong>What the hell indeed.</strong></p>
<p>I genuinely have no idea how February went by so fast. It feels like just a week ago I wrote my January review. But time doesn’t wait for anyone, so let’s get on with it.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t remember much from the start of the month, but looking back at my notes, it’s all coming back.</p>
<p>I worked on some computer vision projects for work. I’ve learned a lot and it’s a really interesting field, and I can feel myself getting more comfortable with it. That part of the month felt productive and meaningful.</p>
<p>Blog-wise, I published only one piece which feels unfortunate because I had so much more planned. The one I did publish was my <strong><a href="https://medium.com/@beyondmebtw/the-2025-formula-1-season-review-00240674d77a">2025 F1 season review</a></strong>. I started it in January, and it somehow took the entire month to finish. But honestly, it felt really nice writing it. I’m proud of it. I just didn’t get the chance to write the other pieces I had in mind like a guide to the new season and some movie and TV reviews.</p>
<p>It’s race week now, and that feeling of emptiness will disappear soon. F1 is something I genuinely enjoy. It gives me something to look forward to, something to analyze, something to feel. Maybe getting back into that rhythm will help me enjoy everything else more too.</p>
<hr>
<p>This month I also started a <strong>(dopamine detox)[<a href="https://minis.beyondmebtw.com/post/mini_xx0ai0/%5D">https://minis.beyondmebtw.com/post/mini_xx0ai0/]</a></strong>. The first week was fine. The second week is still ongoing, so we’ll see how it turns out. It’s an experiment for now.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the month just flew by. I had an exam which went well. And slowly, it’s starting to sink in that college life is ending. I have no regrets about how I spent my time or who I spent it with. I did what I wanted to do. I learned a lot. I built things. But I’ll wait for it to actually end before I let myself get nostalgic.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve also been feeling a bit sad because of everything going on in the world. I won’t go into detail as it’s just depressing. I try to stay off social media because of the detox and because of the constant noise, but whenever I do see the news, it sucks. The answer isn’t to avoid it completely because you can’t. It’s about finding a way through it. I know it’s privileged to even say that compared to what others are going through, but all I can really do is keep a positive attitude and focus on building what I can.</p>
<p>March should be a fun one. I’m getting back into the groove of writing and creating again. With F1 starting up, that momentum will probably only grow.</p>
<p><strong>Full speed ahead.</strong></p>
