I’ve still been writing: show reviews, bits about life, and recently, that whole journey with the DepthAI project. But this one hits differently. This one comes after getting hit with a brick. Not literally… though honestly, that might feel easier than what this past quarter has been.</p>
<p>When I look back at the last three months, I’ve been carrying the entire software world’s sins on my shoulders. If Android has an error, <strong>I</strong> feel broken. My dad told me straight: I need to stop taking every bug personally. And he’s right, I’ve tied every failure to who I am. It’s gotten bad enough that I don’t work because I fear either succeeding… or failing again.</p>
<p>What is worse? I chase errors now. Because if I find one, I get a free pass to delay everything till the next big disaster. And I’ve been doing exactly that.</p>
<p>I’m scared. <strong>Really</strong> scared. And it’s not like I’m behind, everything is up to date, files ready, environment set. One click to build and I still backed away.</p>
<p>If I keep running from problems like this, why am I even in software? This is a crisis of confidence, plain and simple, It’s the worry that people will think less of me… or worse, that <strong>I</strong> will.</p>
<p>There will always be problems. That’s the job. But once you solve them, they’re gone. I don’t have to carry them forever.</p>
<p>So I’m leaving all that weight behind. Not looking back. Just driving forward — fast, focused, relentless until I get tired. And even when I do, I’ll rest without regret. As Elsa said “Let It Go!”</p>
<p>It’s a new month, the final stretch of the year. I’m not waiting for signs or motivation or fate to approve my progress. I’m done with that.</p>
<p>I’m capable. I’ve got this.</p>
<p>And yes — expect the DepthAI project to be up and running very soon.</p> </div> </article> <a href="/" class="back-link">&larr; Back to all minis</a> </main> <div class="footer"> <div>
